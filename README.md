Happy Halloween! I've finally decided to take the plunge and version-control my game the
smart way using GitHub instead of doing it manually in Dropbox. The first commit
represents the game in its most complete state so far; from now on I'll make incremental
updates via commit as God and GitHub intended.

I'm making this game as part of my MFA studies in Design and Technology at Parsons the New
School for Design. During the pre-program Bootcamp session I first created a basic game
involving navigating a bouncing ball across platforms. I built on the concept for my
Creativity and Computation Lab class, finding better ways to do collision detection and
level design and honing the game mechanics. As part of learning about object-oriented
programming we had to build a character out of nested objects and I decided to incorporate
the result (notKirby) into my game.

Finally I realized I could adapt the project for use in my Major Studio assignment,
"Instruction Sets from Strangers." As a student of game design I'm interested in how
games instruct players, overtly and subliminally, and this is a perfect opportunity to
explore those themes, if in a largely primitive form.
